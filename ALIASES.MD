# Aliases

the `/aliases` directory contains command aliases to simplify many commands used in development.





## Getting Started
to utilize these aliases they need to be added to your bash profile.  Commonly, .bashrc already has a provision for `~/.bash_aliases` you may want to verify with your current shell.

Once the inclusion onf .bash_aliases is confirmed you need to install(copy) the aliases file into your home directory.

    cp ./aliases/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases
